## üéØ How to Play

### Objective
Knock your opponent's penguin off the iceberg by moving strategically and using your slap ability. The first player to win 10 rounds wins the game!

### Game Flow
1. **Character Selection**: Each player chooses a unique colored penguin
2. **Movement & Combat**: Use keyboard controls to move and slap
3. **Win Conditions**: Push your opponent off the edge or slap them off the iceberg
4. **Victory**: First to 10 round wins takes the championship!

### Controls

| Player | Movement | Slap |
|--------|----------|------|
| **Player 1** | W, A, S, D | SPACEBAR |
| **Player 2** | Arrow Keys | ENTER |

### Game Mechanics
- **Movement**: Smooth directional movement with momentum and friction
- **Slapping**: 1-second cooldown between slaps with visual feedback
- **Physics**: Realistic collision detection and force application
- **Boundaries**: Fall off any edge of the iceberg to lose the round

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Architecture
The game is built with vanilla web technologies for maximum compatibility and performance:

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure and game layout
- **CSS3**: Responsive design, animations, and visual effects
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Game logic, physics engine, and user interactions

### Key Features
- **Character Selection System**: 7 unique penguin colors with visual selection interface
- **Real-time Physics**: Custom physics engine with velocity, friction, and collision detection
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS transitions and JavaScript-driven movement
- **Visual Feedback**: Slap animations, scaling effects, and visual indicators
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Game State Management**: Proper game flow with multiple screens and state tracking

### File Structure
```
slappypenguin/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main game HTML structure
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css           # All styling and animations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js           # Game logic and physics engine
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # This documentation
```

### Code Highlights

#### Physics Engine
- Custom collision detection between penguins
- Momentum-based movement with realistic friction
- Force application for slapping mechanics
- Boundary detection for win/lose conditions

#### Visual System
- Pixel-art style penguin sprites created with SVG
- CSS filter-based color variations
- Smooth animations for slapping and movement
- Dynamic visual feedback for game events

#### Game Logic
- Turn-based round system with score tracking
- Cooldown management for balanced gameplay
- Multiple game states (character selection, gameplay, game over)
- Event-driven input handling for responsive controls

## üé® Customization

### Adding New Penguin Colors
Edit the `colorFilters` object in `script.js`:
```javascript
const colorFilters = {
    newcolor: 'hue-rotate(XXXdeg) saturate(XXX%) brightness(XXX)',
    // Add your custom filter here
};
```

### Adjusting Game Mechanics
Key variables in `script.js` you can modify:
- `slapForce`: How hard penguins get knocked back
- `slapCooldown`: Time between slaps (milliseconds)
- `winScore`: Rounds needed to win the game
- `friction`: How quickly penguins slow down

### Styling Changes
Modify `style.css` to customize:
- Game arena appearance
- Penguin animations
- UI colors and fonts
- Button styles and effects

## üîß Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome**: Full support ‚úÖ
- **Firefox**: Full support ‚úÖ
- **Safari**: Full support ‚úÖ
- **Edge**: Full support ‚úÖ
- **Mobile browsers**: Optimized for touch devices ‚úÖ
